* Doubt
#+BEGIN_VERSE
It perishes journey
It perishes relation
It perishes a being
Just a doubt -
When it sprouts
#+END_VERSE

* Drowsy
#+BEGIN_VERSE
In dream, dear soul
By which light do you see?
So stay alert with That
In world when you go drowsy
That light is Awareness
Ever shining in its bareness
#+END_VERSE

* Bring toils to fruition
#+BEGIN_VERSE
Do it â€”
For mother's labor
For father's sweat
For Guru's hope
For lover's eyes
This sacrifice, to
Bring toils to fruition
A seeker's volition
#+END_VERSE
